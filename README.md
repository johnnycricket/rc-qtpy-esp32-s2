# Custom RC with QTPY esp32-s3 as web-page server and motor control

## Overview

To make an affordable remote control for small model trains, it's possible to use a small lipo batter, a h-bridge to control the motor, and a QTPY esp32-s3 to communicate with the h-bridge and run a web server that the user can load as a web page to control the motor remotely.
